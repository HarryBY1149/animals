    <h1>Dogs are the Best Animals</h1>
    <h2>Why are dogs the best animals?</h2>
    <p> Dogs are the best animals because they will hang out with you when no one else will.
        They don't care if you stink, if you eat too much, if you love children's cartoons 
        or even if you are a complete and utter failure.
    </p>

    <p> Unconditional love is only a small part of what makes dogs so fantastic. They can also learn to play games,
        smoke cigarettes, ride surfboards, sing pop songs and dance. No other animal will put up with as much prodding and poking for as little reward as a dog.
        Patience, tolerance, and a love of nonsense are just a few of the characteristics of dogs that any self-respecting human can appreciate.
